# Why Source-Available instead of Open-Source?
Simply put, we do not want Aimmy to be published in a commercial setting. We greatly encourage users to modify Aimmy however they see fit, however, **we do not want a third party to profit off the software**, and this is a value that the Open-Source community does not share.

Aimmy was developed in a community where subsets of it are admittedly profit-motivated. This can be exemplifed with the recent release of a tool that requires the users to go through not one, not two, but five ad-only webpages before using the program.

This is not an environment we would like to promote. Though because of this, we are also aware that making the source of Aimmy available to the public makes Aimmy an attractive base for Software Developers looking to make a similar product. Making Aimmy closed-source however is not an option we would like to take. Because of this, we decided to make Aimmy source-available.

We do not permit versions of Aimmy to be distributed commercially unless value is added into the modified distribution.
